# Nexzite Terms Of Service

We may update this policy at any time, and we'll do so without notifying you directly. By using Nexzite, you agree to the most current version of our Terms of Service,
so we recommend checking back here regularly to stay up to date.

The team of Nexzite have tried to make bot more useful and updated as possible. By using our APP our Terms will be automatically applied to you. We may update the app 
or introduce charges for its services at any time, for any reason. However, if we do, we'll always be upfront about what you're paying for. You'll never be caught off guard.

Nexzite lets you send messages to Discord channels, but it doesn't clearly show who is responsible for each message.
Because of this, the owner of the Discord server is held accountable for any actions or messages sent by the bot.

**The following actions are strictly prohibited in our Discord bot:**

- Sending any kind of advertisements by using our message system.
- Using any type of unauthorized automation within Discord.
- Attempt to misuse of bot bugs and features.
- Using Nexzite for violating any kind of **Discord Community Guidelines**.
- Engage in unauthorized framing of or linking to the website.
- Attempt to Defraud or Scam users to get their sensitive or private information.
- Make improper use of our support services or submit false reports of abuse or misconduct.

> Note : Breaking any of the following things will lead to blacklisting and banning from our services.
